This is a game I am currently working on, but it has turned more into an AI project where I program an enemy AI to navigate a level in a 2D platformer

To give you a glimpse of my AI I am currently working on, I created a video below to show you what it can do currently.

If you want to see some of the scripts I wrote, go to the Assets folder and then click on the Scripts folder.
